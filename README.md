CS 470 Final Reflection
CS 470:Project two - YouTube
Experiences and Strengths:
• What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a 
more marketable candidate in your career field?
There are lots of skills I gained from this course that I didn’t even have knowledge of before. 
Some of the once I am most comfortable with are working with Docker compose, now I have the 
knowledge of how to create multiple containers and run them with commands. Another one is 
working with AWS tools, like using S3 to create buckets and uploading data into them on to the 
cloud. I Also gained knowledge of using DynamoDB like creating tables with data and gained 
the knowledge of the API gateway to create restful API and connect it with the S3 and database. 
Another strength is the Lambda cloud computing system and how it works depending on the 
trigger from events like from S3.
• Describe your strengths as a software developer.
My strength as a software developer is that I learned about couple of different computer 
languages like C++, C#, java, javascript, and python also mark up language like HTML and also 
style sheet language like CSS. Another strength is that combining different type of languages to 
make it work together like connecting frontend with the backend using API. 
• Identify the types of roles you are prepared to assume in a new job.
The types of roles I am preparing for are full stack developer, Cloud application 
developer and devop.
Planning for Growth:
Computing with cloud is really good for scaling of application and management. 
With cloud computing all you do is pay as you go so there will be no coast for 
space that you are not using. Container based will cost as you need more 
resources like CPU and disk ect. Some of the pros are that there are lots of tools 
like with AWS which will make developers job much easier and can save time to 
do some other project. For big business AWS allows them to deal with on site 
data center and that can be expensive.
